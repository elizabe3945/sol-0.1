This contract defines a mapping called _data which associates each Ethereum address with a string of data. The setData function allows a user to store their data in the mapping, and the getData function allows anyone to retrieve the data associated with a specific address.

To use this contract, you would deploy it to the Ethereum network using a tool like Remix or Truffle. Once deployed, users could interact with it using a web3-enabled browser like MetaMask or by building a custom dApp.
